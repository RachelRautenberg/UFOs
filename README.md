# UFOs
Module 11

## Overview
During this module we worked with Dana to create a webpage that allows users to check out some UFO data to possibly answer their own musings on the existence of UFOs.
The project undertaking required the set up of a webpage with a table where data could be viewed, but also with the addition of filters the data could be more focused for user interest. 

## Results
When a user first lands on the webpage, they are greeted with a welcome paragraphe, leaving them to speculate our universe.  There is an initial table of information and on the left hand side there are filter options for sorting through in a variety of ways.  The filtering is set up in such a manner that a user can use one, or more, or all, filter options to get to their particular level of curiosity and comparison.

An example of basic filtering would find the user entering just a city and state, then either pressing enter or clicking in to the next box.  In this example, we filtered using Willow, AK.  Note, however, that the data is in all lowercase, so the user actually needs to enter willow and ak.

)

The exciting thing about the setup on this webpage is that it allows users to decide what information is important for their own seeking of answers. 

## Summary

 In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
 
There is one drawback that spiders to a few areas of challenge: data inconsistency and lack of direction for user filtering. The current set up requires a user to use lower case only and to know how the data is entered to be able to filter. When it comes to the data, one obvious inconsistency is that under the shape category, users will also find 'light' and 'formation' as descriptors. These are not a shape, so could be overlooked if the user is looking to explore and compare various shape cateogries. 

Recommendations to combat these challenges would be:
-adjust filters to ignore case
-alter the date and shape filter boxes to be a calendar box and drop down of choices respectively
-change title "shape" to "descriptors" to give a little direction to the potential for filter requests that aren't specifically a shape
